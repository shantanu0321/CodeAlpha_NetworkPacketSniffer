“Hi — I built a Python packet sniffer to learn how data flows on networks. I’ll show how to run it and verify captures.”

“Prerequisites: Python and Scapy; run with admin or sudo.”

- Install with `pip install scapy` then run `python (name of file in which you saved the code).py` like in my case I have used `python p2.py`.

- You’ll see packets printed live — source, destination, protocol, ports, and a small payload preview.

- Stop with Ctrl+C — the script saves TXT, CSV, JSON and PCAP. Open the PCAP in Wireshark to inspect further.
